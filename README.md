Introduction
----------------------

Hello Everyone!

This is food tracking web app I built using the Flask framework which allows one to keep track of their diet and accomplish their fitness goals!
The App allows you to enter the food items you eat throughout the day - nutrients including: Protein, Carbs, Fat and the calories you have consumed. You are able to save this into the database within the app. You may update your entries as you please. On top of this, you can set goals for yourself in those nutrient categories and try to hit those goals throughout the day.
